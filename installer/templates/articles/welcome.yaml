##Bower
>Bower is a package manager for the web. It offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack. There are no system wide dependencies, no dependencies are shared between different apps, and the dependency tree is flat.

To register FlatG in the [bower](http://bower.io/) [registry](http://sindresorhus.com/bower-components/):
`bower register FlatG git://github.com/goliatone/FlatG.git`
