### Collections
Add `Collector`s:
- Glob directory (path) for file extension
- Make index for cache
- Create collection with file => Model

NotesCollector => notes/
PagesCollector => pages/
ImagesCollector => images/

### Drafts:
How do we deal with drafts?
Do we have different folders per collection type?
Maybe just one drafts folder, and between date and type meta then on publish we can move to right path.


### Pages: Build menu from dir structure.
